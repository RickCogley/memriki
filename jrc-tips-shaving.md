# Traditional Shaving Tips

In late summer of 2019, I rediscovered "traditional shaving", which can be classified as shaving that relies on the products that Dad or Grandpa used to use in the 1950s, such as a "double edge" safety razor or straight edge razor, pre-shave oil, shaving cream that you work into a lather using a shaving brush with badger bristles, and a bracing after shave. 

Sometimes you hear it referred to as "wet shaving" and while I'm no expert, that appears to be a superset that includes use of water or oil with any type of shaving equipment, including cartridge or electric razors. 

I'm enjoying shaving this way, and have turned it into a meditative morning ritual, performed before the women of the house arise and invade the bathroom. Besides, it's manly, takes skill, and I like smelling nice. 

There's an initial investment for traditional shaving as you get geared up, but the blades are inexpensive compared to cartridges, once you get a combination that works for you. 

This document is my initial notes based on reading the many online communities like [/r/wicked_edge](https://reddit.com/r/wicked_edge) on Reddit and [Badger and Blade](http://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/), sites like [Sharpologist](https://sharpologist.com), and my own experimentation.  

## Equipment

The basics include: 

* A double-edge "DE" or single-edge "SE" razor, and appropriate blades
* Optional pre-shave oil
* Shaving cream
* Shaving brush 
* After shave

### Razors

There are two main types of "safety razor" - a "double edged" type and a "single edge" type, often designated by their initials DE and SE. There appear to be more DE razor models than SE razor models on the market. There are inexpensive one-piece models out there, which open up when you twist the knob at the bottom, allowing you to install the blade. However, the modern razors all seem to be two or three piece designs, usually with a handle, a solid or "safety" bar (milder) or open comb (more aggressive) baseplate, and a top plate with or without scallops. 

DE examples: 

* [Muhle](https://www.muehleusa.com/) Rocca, Hexagon, or Traditional R81/R89 (milder) or R41 (aggressive)
* [Feather](https://www.feather.co.jp/en/g_Products/general01.html) AS-D2S or WS-D2S
* [Blackland](https://www.blacklandrazors.com/) Blackbird or Dart
* [AboveTheTie](https://www.abovethetie.com/collections/windsor-razors) Windsor
* [Timeless](https://timelessrazor.com/) various combinations of stainless, brass or titanium parts
* [Rockwell](https://getrockwell.com/pages/products) 6S or 6C

* [RazoRock](http://www.razorock.com) aka "Italian Barber" Mamba, Baby Smooth or Game Changer

SE examples: 

* [Supply](https://getsupply.com/) V2 or newer
* [OneBlade](https://www.onebladeshave.com/) Core, Hybrid or Genesis (SE but with a pivoting head)
* Blackland Vector or Sabre
* Schick Type O "injector" original new-old stock, or a [clone](https://www.ebarbershop.com/ebarbershop-schick-type-injector-razor-handle.html)
* RazoRock Hawk

### Blades

There are still a lot of DE and SE blades being produced. 

* Japanese "Feather High Stainless" DE blades are aggressive and may bite a beginner
* Israeli Personna DE blades are milder, and are what Muhle uses for their branded blades
* Derby and Astra DE blades are milder, and more suitable for a beginner
* As for SE blades, Schick Injector I's work in the Supply V2
* Also an SE, the OneBlade models can take Feather FHS-10 blades

### Oil

Jojoba, almond, olive, grapeseed
Famous premade one is proraso

Bellac, Olive Oil is used extensively and for more than cooking and is a Carrier Oil, The Romans used it to Shave and as a Body moisturizer it abosrbs well and doesn't clog your pores.
It's great for removing water stains from Real Wood Furniture and has many health benefits.

During the Winter I blend it with no more than 20% Shea Nut Oil and 20% Soybean Oil, a Lavender EO for Scent (Wife) or Bergamot Mint (me), ~3 drops per oz. It can be used as a Pre-shave, Post-shave & an overnight moisturizer, inexpensive and easy to blend. My Summer Blend is Olive Oil, 20% Soybean Oil and 20% Kukui Oil + EO for Scent.

### Soap

Haven't experimented much. Just using CO Bigelow's cream and working up a lather in my hand then on my face. 

### Brushes

Shaving brush: from 3000 to 30,000 - anaguma or eurasian badger hair is the best. "Silver tip" badger seems to be sought after.

Spiffo's synthetic "luxedo" knot is like badger. https://spiffo.com/shop/pierce/
